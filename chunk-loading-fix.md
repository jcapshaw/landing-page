# ChunkLoadError Fix Implementation

## Problem
The application was encountering a `ChunkLoadError` when loading the `app/layout.js` chunk:
```
Error: ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk app/layout failed.
(timeout: https://rnxj22-3000.csb.app/_next/static/chunks/app/layout.js)
```

## Root Causes
1. **Large Bundle Size**: The AuthProvider component was too large (~280 lines) and loaded synchronously in the root layout
2. **Firebase Authentication Logic**: Complex auth setup with multiple retries created significant JavaScript load
3. **Limited Code Splitting**: No dynamic imports were used for heavy components

## Solution Implemented

1. **Code Splitting for AuthProvider**:
   - Created `LazyAuthProvider.tsx` as a copy of the original AuthProvider
   - Used Next.js dynamic import to lazy load the component:
   ```js
   const LazyAuthProvider = dynamic(() => import('./components/LazyAuthProvider'), {
     ssr: false,
     loading: () => <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">Loading...</div>
   });
   ```

2. **Increased Chunk Loading Timeout**:
   - Added the `pageLoadTimeout` setting to Next.js config:
   ```js
   experimental: {
     pageLoadTimeout: 180, // Increased from default
     externalMiddlewareRewritesResolve: true,
   }
   ```

## Benefits
- **Faster Initial Page Load**: The main layout loads without waiting for the large AuthProvider code
- **Improved User Experience**: Shows a loading indicator while authentication is initializing 
- **Better Error Handling**: More time allowed for chunk loading on slow connections

## Additional Recommendations
1. Split the AuthProvider into smaller modules:
   - Move token management logic to a separate module
   - Extract role fetching into a separate function

2. Consider optimizing bundle size further:
   - Implement Firebase lazy loading 
   - Use tree-shaking for Firebase imports
   - Remove unused functions and error handling bloat
